# Fire Oracle

This was originally a class project that included to create a website
implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
However, I decided to include some machine learning in python though
it was not the main focus I was able to produce a predicted response.

Now that I have the semester, I will be looking to redo my data
analysis and document more of my findings along with thoroughly
check alternative models and hyperparameter tuninigs.

Note: I cannot upload the data onto GitHub since the data is large.
Please feel to download the sql from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2013-0009.6).
Afterwards you will be able to use my script to parse the data into
a csv file.

Thanks,

NiteToad
