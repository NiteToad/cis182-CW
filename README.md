This is a class project that will include some machine learning in python and the rest of the website being completed using javascript, 
jquery, html and css. For now the objective is to get something up and running. 

Note: I cannot upload the data onto GitHub so here is the link to [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2013-0009.6)

Thanks,
