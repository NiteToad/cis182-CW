    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p>This is our attempt to combat the unprecedented wildfires occurring every year. With everyoneâ€™s help we can get the best data available to help us predict and avoid wildfires. This idea sparked into my head from my Java class, were we created a Java application to see historical fires throughout California. Along with this data we were able to see the causes of the fires, the area it covered, etc... Since we finished early our professor suggested we begin looking how we can improve our project and thus the idea to apply arose, unfortunately we also came to the realization that it would be extremely difficult to apply ML successfully with the lack of time and experience from our 3 man team. That was about a year ago, now I have taken some courses to learn about Machine Learning and look for every opportunity to practice the application of ML on different problems. I hope to create a minimally viable prototype that I can continue to work and refine. The short term goal is to create a model that can predict some wildfires in the United States, and the long term goal is to create a model that predict wildfires in North America and wherever else I can get data from. </p>
